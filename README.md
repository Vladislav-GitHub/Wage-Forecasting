# Wage Forecasting

## CS50P
>This was my final project for conclude the CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python.

>python, ML, Linear regression, flask, web development, CS50P
## Features

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

I've used Scikit-learn and Flask web framework based in Python
it was necessary to use Scikit-learn for Machine Learning and Flask, which provides configuration and conventions, with sensible defaults

## Explaining the project
My final project is a website written in python which allows the user to enter candidate's experience, interview scores and test results to get wage prediction and moreover this form has link to my portfolio website.

## project.py for Machine Learning, test_project.py for testing, app.py for a website in which this ML model predicts the candidate wage
All information about experience, test scores, interview scores and wages for each candidate are stored in job_search.csv.


### ML model can be saved in file with ".pkl" extension


## Demonstration on youtube
For the CS50P final project you have to make a video showning your project,

## About CS50P
CS50P is a openware course from Havard University and taught by David J. Malan

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values; variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files.
Thank you for all CS50P.
